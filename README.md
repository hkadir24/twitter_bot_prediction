# twitter_bot_prediction
Supervised learning approach to predict if given twitter user is bot or not.
Used Deep Learning techniques with package tenserflow to create a feedforward network with back propagation.
Result of a user is given as a continous value between 0 and 1 which indicates propability of being a bot.
Additionally, some tweets are analysed as well to predict if the given tweet is political or not. Similiar deep learning techniques
are used for this objective as well.
The whole project is done under the Supervision of Onur Varol.
